## Why We're Unique
Our student-led approach teaches children to take ownership of their learning and explore their interests in depth. We provide opportunities for students to collaborate with peers, present their work to the community, and participate in real-world projects.

## Educational Enrichment Without Limits℠
At Forest Academy, we believe that the best way to learn is through hands-on experience and real-world exploration. Our enrichment programs include a full spectrum of hands-on STEM activities, arts and crafts, music, biology and natural sciences, astronomy, space program participation, sports, national and international road scholarship, and multinational cultural studies.

Our programs provide a wide variety of structured and unstructured learning opportunities. We collaborate with other homeschool co-ops, accredited K-12 learning programs, and subject matter experts in various fields to provide an unrivaled educational experience that goes well beyond the state-mandated core curriculum.
